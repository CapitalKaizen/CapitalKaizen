### Hi there ðŸ‘‹



- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my MEng(Research) in Industrial Engineering Stellenbosch University with the topic pertaining to graph-based algorithmic trading.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning graph-based machine learning.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 22941940@sun.ac.za

My goal in life has always been to make a positive impact on every sphere of my endeavors. I strive to always improve and push the boundaries of my abilities as well as fulfill my full potential.

I have a strong passion for forex trading, and in my free time, I actively trade the market and have created various algorithmic trading bots. I'm grateful for the opportunity and support from Sonic, a hedge fund company, to pursue my Masters in Industrial Engineering. I am currently working on my MEng with the SUnORE (Stellenbosch Unit for Operations Research in Engineering) Group, focusing on graph-based algorithmic trading.

In addition to my academic and research interests, I lead a balanced life. During my free time, I am an avid gym-goer, which helps me maintain a healthy lifestyle and stay motivated. I'm also an avid reader and a fan of self-development. Some of my favorite books include "Can't Hurt Me" by David Goggins and "The 5 AM Club" by Robin Sharma. I'm an enthusiastic podcast listener as well, with favorites like "Diary of a CEO" hosted by Steven Bartlett, "The Ed Mylett Show," "PBD Podcast," and "REAL AF with Andy Frisella."

I look forward to new opportunities and challenges in the world of data engineering and algorithmic trading, and I'm always eager to connect and learn from like-minded individuals.
